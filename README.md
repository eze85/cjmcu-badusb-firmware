# Rubber ducky with cjmcu bad usb
##### Description: This is where you will find the firmware for the cjmcu bad usb atmega32u4 to code it like a rubber ducky and use it directly from the sd card.
##### Objective: The aim of this project is basically; be able to run duckyscripts v3.0 or newer directly from your sd card without flashing the firmware of the board or do it only one time.
##### Note: It supports many languages as arduino decided to incorporate them to the keyboard library so you will not have problems if your keyboard is spanish or english, you'd just need to edit one line.

# How to install it?
#### 1. You must download the sketch, change some settings like the keyboard layout you want to use and upload it to your board.
#### 2. Then you must have a txt file with some duckyscript code in your sd card and it'll work with no problems.
